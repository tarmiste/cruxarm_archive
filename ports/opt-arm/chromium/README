README for chromium


NOTES

	Some features of Chromium > 23.x.x.x use Google APIs, and to access those APIs
	either an API Key or a set of OAuth 2.0 tokens is required. You can specify
	the API keys to use either when you build Chromium, or at runtime using
	environment variables.
	After build chromium you will have a binary without API keys baked in, so
	instead you should provide them at runtime.

	To read more about API keys:

POSTINSTALLATION

	If you can't run chromium and you got a message like this:

	$ chromium
	[1410:1410:1506374616:FATAL:platform_font_gtk.cc(329)] Check failed: typeface.
        Could not find any font: Fixed, sans
        Aborted

	you could solve this by installing for example xorg/xorg-font-dejavu-ttf.
