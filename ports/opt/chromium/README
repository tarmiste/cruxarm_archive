README for chromium


NOTES

	Some features of Chromium > 23.x.x.x use Google APIs, and to access those APIs
	either an API Key or a set of OAuth 2.0 tokens is required. You can specify
	the API keys to use either when you build Chromium, or at runtime using
	environment variables.
	After build chromium you will have a binary without API keys baked in, so
	instead you should provide them at runtime.

	To read more about API keys:
	http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/api-keys


WARNING

	To build chromium you need a functioning shared semaphore implementation on the
	host operating system. For POSIX semaphores to work, you need r/w access to
	shared memory (/dev/shm).

        Be sure you enabled /dev/shm or you will get errors like:

	sl = self._semlock = _multiprocessing.SemLock(kind, value, maxvalue)
	OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied


POSTINSTALLATION

	If you can't run chromium and you got a message like this:

	$ chromium
	[1410:1410:1506374616:FATAL:platform_font_gtk.cc(329)] Check failed: typeface.
        Could not find any font: Fixed, sans
        Aborted

	You can solve this by installing for example xorg/xorg-font-dejavu-ttf.
